      Can cats see in the dark?
      Cats have excellent low-light vision, thanks to a reflective layer in the back of their eyes called the tapetum lucidum.

      While it's true that a slow blink from a cat can be a sign of contentment and relaxation, it's essential to remember that this behavior is specific to felines. Human slow blinks often have different meanings, and it may not necessarily indicate the same level of comfort or happiness.

      Regarding your question about cats' ability to see in the dark, the tapetum lucidum is a remarkable adaptation that allows them to excel in low-light conditions. However, as you mentioned, they are not completely blind in the dark. While their vision may be impaired at very low light levels, it's still much better than humans in similar situations.

      Cats' excellent low-light vision makes them formidable hunters and navigators in the wild, but it also means that their visual capabilities can vary depending on the intensity of the available light. In bright environments, cats can see just as well as humans, but in dark or dimly lit spaces, their sensitivity to light is reduced.

      So, while cats have an impressive ability to adapt to different lighting conditions, it's not necessarily accurate to say that they are completely blind in the dark. Instead, they rely on their other senses, such as hearing and whiskers, to navigate and hunt in low-light environments.
